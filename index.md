Follow me as I retire and proceed to become a sailor, doing boat maintenance in exotic settings.

I purchased Mawie, a 38-foot catamaran, in 2021, and she desperately needed some work to bring her back full-time into the water. I brought her to a marina in Ontario, Canada, and brought her out of the water to have her hulls repaired.  The original plan was to splash back into the water in 2022, but alas, the work was not completed on time.

We are now 2023, and the hulls are fixed.  It's now a race to get her through the Oswego canal before it closes for the season, and then leisurely bob around down to Florida for a passage to the Bahamas in Winter 2024.
