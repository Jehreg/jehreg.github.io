## Episode 2

### The one where we figure out how deep the hole goes.

Deciding to become a competent skipper inside of 3 years, from scratch, in such a way as to not kill yourself... is challenging.

A captain on a small boat is the ultimate jack-of-all-trades; when something breaks, you typically have to MacGyver yourself back to port (though while you can stock a huge amount of matchsticks and gum wrappers, most times you are better served with extra sails and rope...)

Here's a list of knowledge that I will have to accumulate before I feel comfortable heading out without strong supervision or cell phone coverage:

That's a lot...

Certain things have to be learnt in-depth, while others can be learnt at a high level with proper documentation and reference manuals on the boat. Of course, some things, like how to repair a marine toilet may only be learnt on-the-spot as the need arises. A shitty situation may ensue, but let's flush that aside.

Some of these things, like sailing and first aid, will be learnt through actual courses, where certification is the end product.  Other things, like diesel maintenance, can be learnt via mentoring by experts, such as my father.  

It only takes time and money... and determination... but mostly time.
